% 4. Relevant Information:n
%       Vina conducted a comparison test of her rule-based system, BEAGLE, the
%       nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis.  BEAGLE is 
%       a product available through VRS Consulting, Inc.; 4676 Admiralty Way,
%       Suite 206; Marina Del Ray, CA 90292 (213) 827-7890 and FAX: -3189.
%       In determining whether the glass was a type of "float" glass or not,
%       the following results were obtained (# incorrect answers):
% 
%              Type of Sample                            Beagle   NN    DA
%              Windows that were float processed (87)     10      12    21
%              Windows that were not:            (76)     19      16    22
% 
%       The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by 
%       criminological investigation.  At the scene of the crime, the glass left
%       can be used as evidence...if it is correctly identified!
